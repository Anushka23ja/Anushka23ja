# 👋 Hi, I’m Anushka!

👩‍💻 I’m passionate about **AI and machine learning**, especially in how they can be used to solve complex real-world problems in **healthcare** and **business**. My goal is to use intelligent systems to develop solutions that drive meaningful improvement and positive change.

🎓 I hold a **B.S. in Computer Science** from the **University of Washington**, and I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in **Information Systems**. I'm actively seeking **full-time opportunities** in **Software Engineering** and **AI/ML development**.
